# This file controls which tasks are allowed to run each frame.
# Tasks should be uniformly distributed, based on what time they estimate to perform

# The complexity is a percentage compared to a full G-Buffer pass. For example,
# if rendering the gbuffer would take 5 ms, then an complexity of 0.1 means
# the pass will take approximately 5 * 0.1 = 0.5 ms.
# Notice this is an approximation only!
