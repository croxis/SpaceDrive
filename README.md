## Deferred Render Pipeline *Version 2.0*

This is the second version of the Pipeline. If you are looking for the first
version, change to the `master` branch! The master branch was cleaned up a while ago,
if you are looking for even older versions, checkout the `old_master` branch.


### Core Features

- Physically Based Shading
- Deferred Rendering
- Advanced Post-Processing
- Time of Day System
- Plugin System

### Getting Started / Wiki

You should definitely checkout the wiki if you want to find out more about the pipeline:
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tobspr/RenderPipeline/wiki">Render Pipeline WIKI</a>

There is also a page about getting started there: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tobspr/RenderPipeline/wiki/Getting%20Started">Getting Started</a>



### Precompiled builds

If you don't want to compile the pipeline, you can use a precompiled build from here:

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/maxpc6gouqzm9s8/AAAbK05FKpVF8SvT2eBPMpd9a?dl=0
">Precompiled-Builds on Dropbox</a>

Just copy it over to `Code/Native/RSNative.pyd`, you can run the
setup with `python setup.py --skip-native` then.
Those builds are getting uploaded whenever I build the pipeline on my machine, 
so they should be updated most of the time (*At least 64bit, if you need a fresh
32bit build, let me know*).


### Reporting Bugs / Contributing

If you find bugs, or find information missing in the wiki, or want to contribute,
you can find me most of the time in the `#panda3d` channel on freenode.
