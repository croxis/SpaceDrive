## Deferred Render Pipeline *Version 2.0*

This is the second version of the Pipeline. If you are looking for the first
version, change to the `master` branch! The master branch was cleaned up a while ago,
if you are looking for even older versions, checkout the `old_master` branch.

### Core Features

- Physically Based Shading
- Deferred Rendering
- Advanced Post-Processing
- Time of Day System
- Plugin System

### Requirements

- OpenGL 4.3 capable GPU
- Panda3D Development Build ( https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d )
- 1GB Graphics Memory recommended (Can run with less, too)

**Notice**: It seems that the drivers for Intel HD Graphics on Linux are not
capable of all 4.3 features, so the pipeline is not able to run there!
