### Core Features

- Physically Based Shading
- Deferred Rendering
- Advanced Post-Processing
- Time of Day System
- Plugin System

See the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tobspr/RenderPipeline/wiki/Features">Feature List</a>
for a comprehensive list of features.


### Requirements

- OpenGL 4.3 capable GPU
- Panda3D Development Build ( https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d )
- 1GB Graphics Memory recommended (Can run with less, too)

If you want to use the C++ Modules, checkout <a href="https://github.com/tobspr/RenderPipeline/wiki/Building%20the%20CPP%20Modules" target="_blank">
Building the C++ Modules</a> to get a list of requirements for them.

**Notice**: It seems that the drivers for Intel HD Graphics on Linux are not
capable of all 4.3 features, so the pipeline is not able to run there!
