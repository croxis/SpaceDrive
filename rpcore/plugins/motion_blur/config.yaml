            Size of the blur tiles, this also has influence on the maximum
            blur radius. Setting this too high will cause artifacts when objects
            with different motion vectors overlap.

    - blur_factor:
        type: float
        range: [0.0, 1.0]
        default: 0.5
        label: Blur factor

        description: >
            Controls the blur factor, a factor of 1 means the full blur is applied,
            a factor of 0 means no blur at all. You should adjust this so the
            blur is not too strong, otherwise motion sickness can happen.

    - max_blur_radius:
        type: float
        range: [1.0, 64.0]
        default: 10.0
        label: Blur limit
        shader_runtime: true
        description: >
            Controls the maximum possible blur size. Try to set this as low as
            possible without getting artifacts.

    - num_samples:
        type: int
        range: [2, 64]
        default: 24
        label: Blur sample count
        shader_runtime: true
        description: >
            Controls the amount of samples, more samples mean a smoother blur
            but also require more performance.
