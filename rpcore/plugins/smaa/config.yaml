        description: >
            This setting enables temporal antialiasing, which increases the
            antialiasing quality a lot. Basically the scene gets rendered a
            little different every frame, and the results of the current and
            the last frame get merged. This way, flickering is reduced by a lot,
            and the image becomes more smooth.

            The quality of the smaa algorithm. Usually you should choose "ultra",
            since it does not have a significant higher cost, but provides way
            better quality. However, on low-end systems, it might be desireable
            to turn this value down.
