        description: >
            Amount of mipmaps to use for downsampling the scene. A higher
            amount of mipmaps will allow capturing wider blur radii.

            Strength of the bloom, higher values will cause more bloom. Make sure

            This uses the Karis average to reduce often called "fireflies", which are very
