    This plugin adds support for HBAO, a screen space ambient occlusion technique.

settings:

    ray_count: 
        type: int
        range: [4, 128]
        default: 32
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Amount of Rays
        description: >
            Number of rays to use, a higher amount of rays provides a better
            quality, but the performance decreases lineary.

    ray_steps:
        type: int
        range: [1, 16]
        default: 4
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Samples per Ray
        description: >
            Amount of samples to use for each ray while raymarching along the
            tangent direction. A higher amount of samples catches details
            better, but also decreases performance by a lot.
