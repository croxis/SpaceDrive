    This plugin adds support for a higher quality variant of SSAO, a screen space ambient
    occlusion technique. 

settings:

    ray_count: 
        type: int
        range: [4, 64]
        default: 32
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Amount of Rays
        description: >
            Number of rays to use, a higher amount of rays provides a better
            quality, but the performance decreases lineary.

    ray_steps:
        type: int
        range: [1, 12]
        default: 4
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Samples per Ray
        description: >
            Amount of samples to use for each ray while raymarching along the
            tangent direction. A higher amount of samples catches details
            better, but also decreases performance by a lot.

    sample_radius:
        type: float
        range: [5, 100]
        default: 50
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Sample Radius
        description: >
            Size of the sampling radius in pixels, higher values might look better,
            but also perform worse due to less caching.

    tangent_bias:
        type: float
        range: [0.0, 1.5]
        default: 0.4
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Tangent Bias
        description: >
            This setting increases the bias of the tangent angle. If you increase
            this value, the ambient occlusion will miss some samples, but it also
            reduces artifacts.

    max_sample_distance:
        type: float
        range: [0.01, 10.0]
        default: 0.5
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Max sample distance
        description: >
            This setting specifies the maximum distance a sample may have to the center sample, in world space units. This prevents halos, and should be set as small as possible without getting artifacts.
