    This adds support for the Bloom effect (also know as Veil effect), which
    blurs the bright spots on the screen, to increase the perciveness of the brightness.

        type: int

        description: >
            Amount of mipmaps to use for downsampling the scene. A higher
            amount of mipmaps will allow capturing wider blur radii.

        range: [0.5, 50.0]
        default: 7.0

        description: >
            Minimum lumiance required so that a pixel is identified as "bright".
            Only pixels marked as "bright" cause bloom.

    - bloom_strength:
        type: float
        range: [0.2, 10.0]
        default: 4.0

        description: >
            Strength of the bloom, higher values will cause more bloom. Make sure
            to not overuse this.
