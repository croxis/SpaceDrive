            This setting enables temporal antialiasing, which increases the
            antialiasing quality a lot. Basically the scene gets rendered a 
            little different every frame, and the results of the current and
            the last frame get merged. This way, flickering is reduced by a lot,
            and the image becomes more smooth.
