            Resolution of the voxel grid. This highly impacts performance and
            memory requirements. A grid of 32^3 almost requires no memory, while
            a grid of 512^3 requires about 1,0 GB of VRAM. However, the higher
            the grid resolution, the more detail will be visible in the GI.
            Power-of-two sizes are preferred.

            This controls the dimensions of the voxel grid. The voxel grid is
            centered arround the camera, and has an equal size in each dimension.
            This setting controls the size of the grid in world space. A size of
            40.0 for example makes the grid 80x80x80 world-space units big.
