    This plugin adds support for Parallel Split Shadow Maps (PSSM),
    and also sun shading. 

settings:

    pssm_distance:
        type: float
        range: [5.0, 3000.0]
        default: 15.0
        runtime: true
        label: Maximum shadow distance
        description: >
            This controlls the maximum distance up to where shadows
            are rendered. A higher distance means further shadows,
            but also a worse shadow quality.

    sun_distance:
        type: float
        range: [100.0, 10000.0]
        default: 500.0
        label: Sun distance
        description: >
            This controlls how far the sun is away from the scene.
            Basically you don't need to adjust this setting, but in
            case you get artifacts, try increasing this setting.

    split_count:
        type: int
        range: [2, 10]
        default: 7
        label: Amount of PSSM Splits / Cascades
        description: >
            This controlls how many splits are used for the PSSM.
            A higher amount of splits increases the shadow map
            detail and quality, but also increases the performance
            cost by a lot. For every split, the scene has to get
            rendered again, so be careful when choosing high amount
            of splits.

    resolution:
        type: int
        range: [128, 3072]
        default: 2048
        label: Shadowmap resolution
        description: >
            This controlls the resolution of the individual shadowmaps
            of the splits. If you choose a resolution of 512 for example,
            and you have 10 splits, then that makes a total resolution
            of 5120 * 512 for the shadow map. Be careful when choosing high
            defaults, the shadow map will soon take a huge amount of VRam.

    use_pcf:
        type: bool
        default: true
        label: Use hardware filtering (PCF)        
        description: >
            This setting turns PCF on or off. It provides a better shadow
            quality, and theoretically a better performance. However, not all
            GPU's seem to support it.
