    This plugin adds support for Parallel Split Shadow Maps (PSSM),
    and also sun lighting. You should enable the atmospheric scattering plugin,
    otherwise the sun position will be fixed.


settings: !!omap

    - max_distance:
        type: float
        range: [2.0, 2000.0]
        default: 50.0
        runtime: true
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Maximum shadow distance
        description: >
            This controls the maximum distance up to where shadows
            are rendered. A higher distance means further shadows,
            but also a worse shadow quality.

    - sun_distance:
        type: float
        range: [100.0, 10000.0]
        default: 500.0
        label: Sun distance
        description: >
            This controls how far the sun is away from the scene, to avoid
            clipping objects outside of the frustum which still cast shadows.
            Basically you don't need to adjust this setting, but in
            case you get artifacts, try increasing this setting.

    - split_count:
        type: int
        range: [2, 10]
        default: 8
        label: Amount of PSSM Splits / Cascades
        description: >
            This controls how many splits are used for the PSSM.
            A higher amount of splits increases the shadow map
            detail and quality, but also increases the performance
            cost by a lot. For every split, the scene has to get
            rendered again, so be careful when choosing high amount
            of splits.

    - resolution:
        type: int
        range: [128, 3072]
        default: 2048
        label: Shadowmap resolution
        description: >
            This controls the resolution of the individual shadowmaps
            of the splits. If you choose a resolution of 512 for example,
            and you have 10 splits, then that makes a total resolution
            of 5120 * 512 for the shadow map. Be careful when choosing high
            defaults, the shadow map will soon take a huge amount of VRam.

    - use_pcf:
        type: bool
        default: true
        label: Use hardware filtering (PCF)        
        description: >
            This setting turns Percentage Closer Filtering on or off (A simple
            2x2 bilinear filter provided by the GPU).
            It provides a better shadow quality, and theoretically a better 
            performance. However, not all GPU's seem to support it.

    - filter_sample_count:
        type: int
        range: [4, 32]
        default: 16
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Filtering samples
        description: >
            Amount of samples to take for filtering the shadow. The samples are
            choosen randomly on a poisson disk. Higher values provide a better
            shadow quality, but also are more expensive.

    - filter_radius:
        type: float
        range: [0.1, 200]
        default: 25
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Shadow filtering radius
        description: >
            This setting controls the filter size, higher values mean a more
            smooth penumbra. Too high values might (and will) produce artifacts.
            This setting has almost no measureable impact on performance.

    - fixed_bias:
        type: float
        range: [0.0, 2.0]
        default: 0.3
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Depth Bias
        description: > 
            Depth-Based bias. This avoids self-shadowing issues (also known)
            as Shadow-Acne. Too high values will produce gaps in the shadows,
            so try to find the lowest possible value.

    - slope_bias:
        type: float
        range: [0.0, 5.0]
        default: 1.0
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Slope Bias
        description: >
            Slope-Based bias. This avoid self-shadowing issues as well, but instead
            of the fixed bias it adds bias based on the angle between the light
            and the surface.

    - normal_bias:
        type: float
        range: [0.0, 5.0]
        default: 1.0
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Normal Bias
        description: >
            Normal-Based bias. This moves the sample position by a small amount
            into the direction of the surface normal, to avoid self shadowing.

    # PCSS settings

    - use_pcss:
        type: bool
        default: true
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Use PCSS
        description: >
            PCSS adds support for variable penumbra size shadows. Without PCSS,
            all shadows have the same penumbra size at all places. With PCSS,
            the shadow penumbra size increases based on the distance. However,
            PCSS requires additionally computations, and thus is slower than
            regular filtering.

    - pcss_search_samples:
        display_if: {use_pcss: true}
        type: int
        range: [4, 32]
        default: 16
        shader_runtime: true
        label: PCSS Penumbra samples
        description: >
            Amount of samples to take for finding the penumbra size. Higher values
            might produce better results at the cost of performance. 

    - pcss_penumbra_size:
        display_if: {use_pcss: true}
        type: float
        range: [0.1, 300.0]
        default: 100.0
        shader_runtime: true
        label: PCSS Penumbra scale
        description: >
            Scales the penumbra by a fixed factor. This is an artistic setting,
            and does not affect performance much. Lower settings will cause a
            smaller penumbra, while higher settings produce a bigger one. Too
            high values might cause artifacts in the filtering.
