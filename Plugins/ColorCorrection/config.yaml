    This plugin adds support for color correction, vignetting and chromatic
    abberation.

settings: !!omap

    - tonemap_operator:
        type: enum
        values: [optimized, reinhard, uncharted2, exponential, srgb, none]
        default: uncharted2
        label: Tonemap Operator
        shader_runtime: true
        description: >
            This specifies the tonemapping operator, all operators implement
            sRGB color correction as well, except for the none operator which
            just passes through the color. None and SRGB are just for reference,
            and should not be used.

    - reinhard_version:
        display_if: {tonemap_operator: "reinhard"}
        type: enum
        values: [rgb, luminance, white_preserve, luminosity]
        default: rgb
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Reinhard Version
        description: >
            Choose between different versions of the Reinhard Operator. rgb performs
            the operator on the rgb value, luminance on the brightness of the color.
            white_preserve also uses the luma value, but tries to preserve the whites.

    - exponential_factor:
        display_if: {tonemap_operator: "exponential"}
        type: float
        range: [0.01, 5.0]
        default: 0.5
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Exponential factor
        description: >
            The factor for the exponential mapping. Assuming the factor is named
            f, then the output color is computed with 1 - exp(-f*color).

    - vignette_strength:
        type: float
        range: [0.0, 1.0]
        default: 0.5
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Vignette Strength
        description: >
            Controls the strength of the vignette, whereas a strength of 0
            means no vignette.

    - exposure_scale:
        type: scalar
        unit: percent
        range: [0.01, 5]
        default: 2.0
        label: Exposure Scale
        description: Scales the exposure by a fixed value.
